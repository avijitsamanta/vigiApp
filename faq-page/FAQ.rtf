\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 While every report is different, the key to a helpful report is details. Depending on the incident or crime you might want to include details on a vehicle; make, model, color, license plate, direction of travel, etc. When writing a report about a suspect or suspicious person important details might include; approximate age, height, weight, ethnicity, etc. You will always want to include an approximate time. This will help determine a possible pattern in a repeating incident and could be very helpful information to others.\
